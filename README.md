STRIVE TEAM GENERATOR - 

 The app is pretty straight forward, use Bootstrap to add the following features:
    - The user can add a list of names
    - The user can set the number of teams
    - Every time the user clicks on the "assign" button, a random name is placed in a team and removed from the list
    - Each team should be inside a "column"
    - [EXTRA] Create a button to remove an user from a team, putting him back in the main list
    - [EXTRA] Create a button to reset the state of the app
